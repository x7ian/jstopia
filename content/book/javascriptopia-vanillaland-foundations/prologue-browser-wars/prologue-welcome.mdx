# Welcome to JavaScriptopia

<Callout kind="note" title="Prologue">
  This lesson is story + onboarding. It is safe for beginners.
</Callout>

<DocBlock anchor="welcome-to-javascriptopia" kind="explanation" title="Welcome to JavaScriptopia">
Welcome to JavaScriptopia.

In the beginning, the web was mostly static. HTML and CSS could shape a page, but the world had no real motion.
JavaScript changed that by giving pages **behavior** and **logic**.

This journey teaches you to read code, think clearly, and build skills step by step.
</DocBlock>

<DocBlock anchor="how-this-journey-works" kind="rule" title="How this journey works">
Each lesson has two parts:

- **Scrollbook docs** with examples and explanations
- **Challenges** that test what you learned
</DocBlock>

<DocBlock anchor="learn-vs-challenge" kind="example" title="Learn vs Challenge">
**Learn Mode**: read first, then take the quiz.

**Challenge Mode**: jump straight to the quiz and learn by correcting mistakes.

<Callout kind="tip" title="Beginner tip">
Start in Learn Mode until the basics feel easy.
</Callout>
</DocBlock>

<DocBlock anchor="teleport-explanation" kind="example" title="Teleport to explanation">
Every question is linked to the exact doc block that explains it.
If you get stuck, you can **teleport** to that block, read it, and try again.
</DocBlock>

<DocBlock anchor="future-goals" kind="rule" title="Future goals">
Later in the journey you will master two big ideas:

- **Runtime**: the environment where JavaScript runs
- **Loop**: how execution is scheduled

For now, just know they are long-term goals.
