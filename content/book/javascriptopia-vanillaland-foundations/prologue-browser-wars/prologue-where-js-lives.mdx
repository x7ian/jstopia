# Where JavaScript Lives

JavaScript runs in more than one place.
Each environment gives JS different powers and limits.

<DocBlock anchor="what-is-a-browser" kind="explanation" title="What is a browser?">
A browser is an application that loads web pages, runs JavaScript, and updates the screen.
It provides **web APIs** like the DOM, events, and fetch.
</DocBlock>

<DocBlock anchor="js-in-the-browser" kind="example" title="JS in the browser">
Browser JavaScript usually starts in a script tag or module.
It can respond to user actions and update the page.
</DocBlock>

<DocBlock anchor="js-on-the-server" kind="example" title="JS on the server">
Server-side JavaScript usually runs in Node.
It can read files, talk to databases, and build APIs.
</DocBlock>

<DocBlock anchor="environments-summary" kind="rule" title="Different environments">
JavaScript runs in the **browser** and on the **server**.
The language is the same, but the available APIs are different.
