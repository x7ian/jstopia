# Where JavaScript Lives

JavaScript runs in more than one place. Each environment gives JS different powers and limits.

<DocBlock anchor="what-is-a-browser" kind="explanation" title="What is a browser?">
A browser is an application that:
- loads HTML and CSS,
- runs JavaScript,
- updates the screen,
- and provides **Web APIs** (DOM, events, fetch, storage, timers, etc).

Think of it as a ship with:
- a **JavaScript engine** (runs your code),
- and a toolbox of **browser APIs** (what your code can control).
</DocBlock>

<DocBlock anchor="js-in-the-browser" kind="example" title="JS in the browser">
Browser JavaScript is built for interaction:
- user clicks
- keyboard input
- page updates
- network requests
- UI animations

In the browser, JavaScript’s main mission is:
**react to events and update the page.**

<DocBlock anchor="js-on-the-server" kind="example" title="JS on the server">
JavaScript can also run on servers (most commonly with Node.js and related runtimes).
On servers, JavaScript can:
- read files,
- talk to databases,
- build APIs,
- run background tasks.

Same language. Different environment. Different toolbox.

<DocBlock anchor="environments-summary" kind="rule" title="Different environments, different powers">
One of the most important beginner skills is learning to separate:

- **JavaScript the language** (variables, functions, objects, async patterns)
from
- **Environment APIs** (DOM in browsers, filesystem on servers, etc)

This prevents confusion like:
“Why doesn’t `document` exist in Node?”  
Because `document` is a browser API, not the JavaScript language.

<Callout kind="tip" title="Skill check">
When something is missing, ask: “Is this a language feature or an environment API?”
</Callout>
