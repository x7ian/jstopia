# The Browser Wars (Real History)

<DocBlock anchor="browser-wars-intro" kind="explanation" title="The first Browser War">
Before modern standards, the web went through a defining era called the **first Browser War** (roughly 1995–2001).
Browsers were fighting to become the main gateway to the web.

<DocBlock anchor="browser-wars-protagonists" kind="example" title="The protagonists">
Two companies defined the era:

- **Microsoft**, led by CEO Bill Gates
- **Netscape**, led by CEO Jim Barksdale

Microsoft controlled the operating system most people used. Netscape built the pioneering Navigator browser.
Their rivalry pushed browsers to evolve into full platforms.

The conflict shaped how browsers were distributed, how standards grew, and how web development evolved.
It is one reason JavaScript became so important inside the browser.
