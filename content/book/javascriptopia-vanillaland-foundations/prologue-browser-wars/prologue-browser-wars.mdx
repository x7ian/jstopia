# The Browser Wars (Real History)

<DocBlock anchor="browser-wars-intro" kind="explanation" title="The first Browser War">
JavaScript didn’t appear in a vacuum.

In the early web era, browsers were competing to become the main gateway to the internet. Companies raced to ship features, win users, and define the platform. This era is often called the **first Browser War** (roughly the late 1990s into the early 2000s).

The result shaped everything we build today:
- how browsers work,
- why standards matter,
- and why JavaScript became the language of the web.

Two forces shaped the era:

- **Netscape**
  A pioneer of the early web. Navigator became widely used, and Netscape pushed the web forward quickly.

- **Microsoft**
  A massive software company that entered the browser race aggressively, bundling Internet Explorer and pushing its own direction for web technology.

This wasn’t only a technical competition — it was about who would define the rules of the web.

Our lore dramatizes the era for fun. The facts matter because they shaped the platform you learn today.

<DocBlock anchor="why-it-mattered" kind="rule" title="Why it mattered (for you)">
The Browser Wars explain several “weird realities” of modern JavaScript:

- Different browsers shipped different behaviors.
- Standards became critical to avoid chaos.
- Engines evolved dramatically to run code faster and safer.
- Modern JavaScript became portable: a shared language across an enormous ecosystem.

In JavaScriptopia terms:
This was the era when the JavaScriptphere began expanding — and bugs began mutating across environments.

**history shaped the platform, and the platform shaped the language.**
