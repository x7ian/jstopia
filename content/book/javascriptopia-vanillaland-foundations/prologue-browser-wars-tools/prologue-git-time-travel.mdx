# Git: Time Travel for Code

Git is your time machine.
It saves snapshots of your project so you can recover and explore.
You will learn commands later - today is the concept.

<DocBlock anchor="what-is-git" kind="explanation" title="What is Git?">
Git is a version control system.
It tracks changes over time so you can revisit any point.
It is essential for teamwork and safety.
</DocBlock>

<DocBlock anchor="commit-as-snapshot" kind="rule" title="Commit as snapshot">
A commit is a saved snapshot of your project.
Each snapshot has a message and a unique id.
You can move between snapshots to see the past.
</DocBlock>

<DocBlock anchor="branch-as-timeline" kind="rule" title="Branch as timeline">
A branch is a line of development.
You can experiment in a branch without breaking main.
Later you can merge or discard it.
</DocBlock>

<DocBlock anchor="remote-and-origin" kind="rule" title="Remote and origin">
A remote is a copy of the repo stored elsewhere.
Origin is the default remote name.
Remotes let teams share and sync work.
</DocBlock>

<DocBlock anchor="common-mistakes" kind="warning" title="Common mistakes">
Forgetting to commit makes history unclear.
Messy history makes collaboration harder.
Small, clear commits are the safest path.
