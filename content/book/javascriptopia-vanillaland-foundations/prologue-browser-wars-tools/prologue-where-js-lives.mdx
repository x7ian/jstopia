# Where JavaScript Lives

JavaScript runs in many places.
Each place has different powers and limits.
You should know the basics before you travel.

<DocBlock anchor="what-is-a-browser" kind="explanation" title="What is a browser?">
A browser is a runtime with a rendering engine and web APIs.
It reads HTML/CSS, runs JavaScript, and updates the screen.
Think of it as an app platform for the web.
</DocBlock>

<DocBlock anchor="js-in-the-browser" kind="example" title="JS in the browser">
You can load scripts with a script tag or a module.
The browser provides DOM, fetch, and events.
Your code reacts to user actions.
</DocBlock>

<DocBlock anchor="js-on-the-server" kind="example" title="JS on the server">
Node runs JavaScript outside the browser.
It can read files, run servers, and automate tasks.
It has no DOM by default.
</DocBlock>

<DocBlock anchor="other-runtimes" kind="rule" title="Other runtimes">
There are more worlds: Deno, edge workers, and embedded runtimes.
They all run JS but offer different APIs.
