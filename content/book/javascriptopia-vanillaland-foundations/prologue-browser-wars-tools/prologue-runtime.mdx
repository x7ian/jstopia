# The Runtime

The runtime is the world your code lives in.
Different worlds give different tools.
This is why the same code can feel different in the browser vs Node.

<DocBlock anchor="what-is-runtime" kind="explanation" title="What is a runtime?">
A runtime is the environment that runs your JavaScript.
It provides the engine, the event loop, and extra APIs.
JavaScript is the language, the runtime is the city it runs in.
</DocBlock>

<DocBlock anchor="browser-runtime-vs-node-runtime" kind="example" title="Browser runtime vs Node runtime">
Browsers provide DOM APIs, windows, and visual events.
Node provides file system, servers, and system access.
Same language, different tools.
</DocBlock>

<DocBlock anchor="apis-provided-by-runtime" kind="rule" title="APIs provided by the runtime">
The runtime gives you extra abilities.
In the browser you get DOM, fetch, and events.
In Node you get fs, path, and process.

<Callout kind="example" title="Example">
  fetch exists in browsers by default, while fs exists in Node. They are different tools.
</Callout>
</DocBlock>

<DocBlock anchor="common-mistakes" kind="warning" title="Common mistakes">
A common mistake is to assume every API exists everywhere.
Code that runs in a browser can fail in Node, and vice versa.
Always check the environment.

<Callout kind="warning" title="Reality check">
  "JavaScript" is not a single environment. The runtime decides what is possible.
</Callout>
