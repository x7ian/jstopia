# Variables with let and var

You sit by the campfire and gather your supplies. In Data Forest, every value needs a name.
Today you learn how to store, update, and reason about variables without getting lost in the trees.

## Objectives
- Declare, initialize, and update variables.
- Explain the difference between let and var at a practical level.
- Apply safe naming rules (camelCase, descriptive names).
- Predict scoping behavior for let vs var (block vs function/global).
- Avoid common mistakes like redeclaration and accidental globals.

<DocBlock anchor="what-is-a-variable" kind="explanation" title="What is a variable?">
A variable is a **named container** for a value. You can read the value and write a new one later.

```js
let food = "berries";
console.log(food); // "berries"
food = "mushrooms";
```

<Callout kind="tip" title="Idea">
Think of a variable as a label stuck to a box. You can swap what is inside the box.
</Callout>
</DocBlock>

<DocBlock anchor="declaring-vs-initializing" kind="rule" title="Declaring vs initializing">
Declaring creates the variable. Initializing gives it its first value.

```js
let score;        // declared, not initialized
score = 10;       // now initialized

let lives = 3;    // declared + initialized
```

<Callout kind="note" title="Rule of thumb">
Initialize as soon as you know the first value. It reduces bugs later.
</Callout>
</DocBlock>

<DocBlock anchor="let-basics" kind="example" title="let: modern variable">
Use `let` for values that will change. It allows reassignment and is block-scoped.

```js
let stamina = 5;
stamina = stamina + 1;
```

<Callout kind="tip" title="Default choice">
Prefer `let` for reassignable variables. It behaves predictably in blocks.
</Callout>

<Callout kind="note" title="What is the console?">
The console is a developer log that shows messages from your code. `console.log()` prints a value so you can see it while you learn and debug.
</Callout>

    { name: "main.js", language: "js", content: `const name = "Ada";
let score = 0;
console.log(\`\${name} score: \${score}\`);
score = score + 5;
console.log(\`Score is now \${score}\`);` },
  ]}

</DocBlock>

<DocBlock anchor="var-basics" kind="example" title="var: legacy behavior">
`var` is function-scoped and hoisted in ways that can surprise you.

```js
function camp() {
  if (true) {
    var torch = "lit";
  }
  console.log(torch); // "lit"
}
```

<Callout kind="warning" title="Legacy">
Avoid `var` in new code unless you are maintaining older codebases.
</Callout>
</DocBlock>

<DocBlock anchor="block-scope-vs-function-scope" kind="gotcha" title="Scope difference: block vs function">
`let` respects block boundaries. `var` ignores them.

```js
if (true) {
  let apples = 3;
  var berries = 4;
}

// apples is NOT accessible here
console.log(berries); // 4
```

<Callout kind="gotcha" title="Scope">
Use `let` when you want a variable to disappear after a block ends.
</Callout>
</DocBlock>

<DocBlock anchor="hoisting-high-level" kind="gotcha" title="Hoisting (high-level, practical)">
`var` is hoisted and initialized to `undefined`. `let` exists in the temporal dead zone (TDZ).

```js
console.log(pack); // undefined
var pack = "rope";
```

```js
console.log(map); // ReferenceError
let map = "trail";
```

<Callout kind="gotcha" title="Why errors happen">
Accessing a `let` variable before declaration throws because it is not ready yet.
</Callout>
</DocBlock>

<DocBlock anchor="naming-and-typo-tips" kind="rule" title="Naming & typo prevention tips">
Use descriptive, camelCase names and avoid confusing characters.

```js
let totalCoins = 12;
let playerHealth = 80;
```

<Callout kind="tip" title="Naming tips">
- Use camelCase for variables and functions.
- Reserve UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants later.
- Avoid confusing names like l/I/O/0.
- Descriptive names beat short ones.
</Callout>

<p>Try changing the variable names or values, then run the code. Reset when you want the original setup back.</p>

<DocBlock anchor="common-mistakes" kind="warning" title="Common mistakes">
Avoid accidental globals, redeclarations, and confusing shadowing.

```js
let level = 1;
let level = 2; // error: redeclaration
```

<Callout kind="warning" title="Mistakes">
These mistakes create bugs that are hard to trace. Always declare your variables.
